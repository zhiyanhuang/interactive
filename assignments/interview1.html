          <b>Christopher Bollen</b>
          <br>
          <p><strong>You just published your third novel. Having already written two books, was it easier this time around?<strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Yeah, so much easier, but also harder in the test I set for myself. I always try to put myself in uncomfortable positions at the beginning. In this instance, I was so unused to writing in the first person that it was a challenge. I’m such a brain hopper as a writer. I like to write in third person. It was hard for me to stay in one person’s head the whole time. It was claustrophobic and I didn’t particularly like the character as I was writing him. In the end, I actually did like him, but for about half the book I kept thinking of ways to kill him off, but it’s really hard to kill your first-person protagonist.</p>
          <p><strong>In other ways, it was so much easier to write. I feel like people say this all the time, that every time you write a novel it’s like you’ve never written one before. I might find the fourth one is extremely painful and difficult, but from where I stand after writing this third one, I can say that it became a little less painful. It was still very hard, but I had the confidence of the first two novels to help propel me.<strong></p>
            <span class="highlight">What I felt more confident about this time, strangely enough, was that I didn’t feel the pressing need that I did with the first book—and a little bit even with the second one—of putting my heart and soul into every line. That doesn’t mean that I didn’t work very hard on every sentence, I just realized that you don’t necessarily
              <em>always</em>
              "need to include little bits of your heart or your obsessions. It doesn’t have to be so desperately personal."
            </span>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>"All the characters don’t have to be personal reflection of me. I don’t have to see every thought they have as a reflection of my thoughts about the world. In a way, it’s such a freedom. You realize that this isn’t really about you necessarily. It has a lot to do with me, obviously, and there’s a lot of me in the book, but it doesn’t have to be some declaration of my inner psyche. Once I got rid of that, this rather narcissistic idea of writing, it was so much easier to control and see ahead and understand what had to happen and how it could happen best and how best to articulate it. That was a relief. As much as I love my first book, Lightning People, it is a novel in crisis in a lot of ways. It suffers from first novel syndrome, which is that you never think you’re going to write another novel, so you literally try and put every thought you’ve ever had into one book. There are literally five novels in that one book that want to become something else, all tugging in different directions.
