    <h1>Reading response D</h1>
    <i>

I like to repeat one thing, that makes me relax. At the same time, I can also ask myself more questions about the repeating.<br>
There are a lot of time we cannot explain our behaviors of course. So we need to use some time to think about our own actions, feelings, directions, etc...<br>
Maybe we can't find the right answer from the self thinking but it will let us get unexpected inspiration. I like the unexpected result because it is full of experimental and adventure.
