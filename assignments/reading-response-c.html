    <h1>Reading response C</h1>
    <i>Nilas Andersen: To me it fits within the category of schools that have a little bit of anti-establishment aesthetic. Coming from Europe and looking at the Yale website, it looks very different, but also it looks European. It’s completely different from any other American school. I think you see more of things like this in Europe, but not necessarily because they came before. They may have come after this.

Ayham: I wonder if you could talk about the anti-establishment aesthetic. What are all the identities rolled into that? It’s something very unique to making work on the web—that the identity isn’t necessarily just a logo but there’s specific ways of working that can communicate these ideas.

Dan: This site is a good example for how, just like you guys have been expressing, an identity of an institution can emerge not just through logo or visual form, but through user experience and the way in which the site evolves over time. It can have a relationship with other schools or maybe influence other schools or be influenced by them as a system.

Zhiyan: I agree with Nilas. The Yale website shows us a sophisticated school community system instead of current students’ works. I really enjoy this browsing experience even though I’m clearly know this site has a little bit of anti-establishment aesthetic. That means if people don’t get a certain design aesthetic education, they will hard to figure out what this site trying to express. The target group of this site are designers and artists. It’s hard to find a good way to make all the people satisfy. </i>
