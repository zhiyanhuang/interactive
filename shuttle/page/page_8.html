	<p style="width:80%;float:right:margin-left:20%;line-height:30px">I have two black dogs. Sometimes I only have 
one. But once I see him, I know the other one 
will shortly follow. I don’t always have the black 
dogs with me. Some days I feel completely 
weightless, like I’m not carrying a burden. I’m 
so used to the black dogs being around. I feel 
guilty not having them. I worry if they are not 
with me they are with someone else. But when 
they are there I want them to leave. I wish they 
would die and never return. But they can not 
be killed.<br>
The black dogs names are depression and 
anxiety. You never know when they are going 
to come back to their master. Although I am 
their master I have no control over them. They 
are constantly barking. Confusing me. I can’t 
think with them barking so loudly. The shame 
of owning these black dogs is real. You feel 
like they are a sign of weakness. You don’t 
want anyone knowing you have these black 
dogs. Especially dogs you can’t control. When 
you see friends, you put the music on loud, so 
they can’t hear the black dogs. You pull the 
curtain so they can’t see the black dogs. 
You’re so busy worrying about people seeing </p>
